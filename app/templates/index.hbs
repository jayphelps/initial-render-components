<p>Three levels of components nested. <code>house -> cats -> kittens</code>.</p>

<p>
  Fairly similar to a real case, where we have a list of things (level 1),
  each with a bunch of inline editables (level 2), which in turn contain a few inputs etc that are components (level 3).
  In this case of ours it's slow on initial render and when sorting (redrawing the list).
